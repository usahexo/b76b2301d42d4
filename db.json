of the accomplishments of Somali women divers. This event is held annually to recognise the significant role that Somali women play in the diving industry and to promote female empowerment.\n\nDivers in Somalia are typically reserved for men, but over the years, women have become an integral part of the dive community. They play a critical role in keeping coastal communities alive by gathering seafood for their families and local markets.\n\nThe first Somali Women's Dive Day was celebrated on March 8, 2020. The inaugural event honoured 15 Somali female divers who have made a significant contribution to the diving industry. The day featured exhibitions, speeches, and cultural performances. \n\nAjuran Siyaad Samater is one of the organisers of Somalia Women's Diving Day Sudan 2022. She believes that this event is an important way to recognise the important work that Somali women do in the diving industry. \"This event celebrates the resilience and strength of Somali women,\" said Ajuran. \"We are proud to be professional divers and we will continue to break barriers and defy expectations.\" \n\nSomalia Women's Diving Day Sudan 2022 is an important way to promote gender equality and empower Somali women.
