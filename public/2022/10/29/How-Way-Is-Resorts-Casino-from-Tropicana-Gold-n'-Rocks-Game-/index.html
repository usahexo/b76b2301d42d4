<h1 id="Golden-Nugget-Beats-Tropicana-in-Clash-of-Atlantic-City-Casinos"><a href="#Golden-Nugget-Beats-Tropicana-in-Clash-of-Atlantic-City-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Golden Nugget Beats Tropicana in Clash of Atlantic City Casinos"></a>Golden Nugget Beats Tropicana in Clash of Atlantic City Casinos</h1><p>The Tropicana casino in Atlantic City has long been considered one of the better casinos in the city. But a recent report suggests that it might now be second best to the Golden Nugget.</p>
<p>The independent report, compiled by ratings agency Gaming Insights and released earlier this month, ranks the Golden Nugget as the top casino in Atlantic City. The Tropicana ranks second, followed by Caesars and Harrah’s.</p>
<p>“The Golden Nugget has really surged ahead of the pack,” said Gavin Isaacs, president of Gaming Insights.</p>
<p>The Golden Nugget benefited from a complete makeover in 2011 that saw it invest $150 million into its property. The result is a luxurious and modern casino that draws players from around the world.</p>
<p>The Tropicana, on the other hand, appears to be losing its edge. The casino was once favored for its large gaming floor and wide variety of table games. But it has since been eclipsed by casinos like the Borgata and Revel, which offer more cutting-edge amenities and gaming options.</p>
<p>In addition, Atlantic City as a whole is facing competition from casinos in neighboring states. The Sands Bethlehem casino in Pennsylvania, for instance, offers nearly double the number of slot machines as any casino in Atlantic City.</p>
