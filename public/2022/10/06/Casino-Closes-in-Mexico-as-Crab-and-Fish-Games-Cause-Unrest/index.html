The bizarre games were taking place at the Casino Los Panchos in Villahermosa, Tabasco and local officials decided to shut down the establishment amid fears that it was causing public unrest.</p>
<p>One video that was widely circulated on social media shows a player using a claw machine to try and snatch a crab from a tank full of them, while other videos show fish being placed into a large betting circle. There were even reports of people being able to bet on how long a fish would live before it was killed.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Mario Gomez Perez, the state’s security spokesman, said that “the games caused public unrest and disorder … We had to take this measure to protect the population.” He added that authorities were investigating whether or not the casino had the correct permits to operate such games.</p>
<p>The casino’s owners released a statement saying that they were “surprised by the closure” and that they had already stopped the games two weeks earlier “out of respect for public order.” They also claimed that the games were only being played by a handful of people and that they had no negative effect on society.</p>
<p>The closure of Casino Los Panchos is just the latest example of Mexico cracking down on gambling establishments. Last year, six casinos were closed in Mexico City for similar reasons.</p>
