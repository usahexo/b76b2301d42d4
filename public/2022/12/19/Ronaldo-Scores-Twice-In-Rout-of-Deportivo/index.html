      <h1 id="Ronaldo-Scores-Twice-In-Rout-of-Deportivo"><a href="#Ronaldo-Scores-Twice-In-Rout-of-Deportivo" class="headerlink" title="Ronaldo Scores Twice In Rout of Deportivo"></a>Ronaldo Scores Twice In Rout of Deportivo</h1><p>Cristiano Ronaldo netted a brace as Real Madrid cruised to a 6-2 victory over Deportivo La Coruna on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Portugal international opened the scoring in the first minute before doubling Madrid’s lead shortly after the break. Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Toni Kroos also got on the scoresheet, with Lucas Perez and Federico Fernandez replying for Deportivo.</p>
<p>Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane made several changes to his starting line-up following Saturday’s goalless draw at home to Atletico Madrid, with Ronaldo and Luka Modric among those recalled. And it was Ronaldo who made the early breakthrough, firing an angled shot past goalkeeper Ruben Martinez after being played in by Marcelo.</p>
<p>Benzema went close to adding a second but his header was cleared off the line by Fernandez, before Bale finally got on the scoresheet in the 37th minute, sidefooting home from close range after being teed up by Modric.</p>
<p>Ronaldo then made it 3-0 shortly after halftime, blasting a volley into the top corner from Kroos’ lay-off. Substitute Perez pulled one back for Deportivo in the 63rd minute, but Madrid restored their three-goal advantage moments later when Benzema headed home from Isco’s cross.</p>
<p>Kroos completed the scoring with a low drive in the 73rd minute as Madrid cruised to an easy victory. The result moves Madrid up to second place in La Liga, eight points behind leaders Barcelona.</p>
<h1 id="Hard-Numbers-Prove-That-Real-Madrid-Is-a-Dominant-Team"><a href="#Hard-Numbers-Prove-That-Real-Madrid-Is-a-Dominant-Team" class="headerlink" title="Hard Numbers Prove That Real Madrid Is a Dominant Team"></a>Hard Numbers Prove That Real Madrid Is a Dominant Team</h1><p>The evidence is in the numbers. And when it comes to soccer (football), Real Madrid’s dominance is undeniable.</p>
<p>Looking at some of the most important stats, we can see that Los Blancos are head and shoulders above their rivals. For example, according to Who Scored, over the last 10 years, Real Madrid has won a staggering 74% of all La Liga matches. In addition, they have been crowned Champions League winners an impressive four times in that same time frame.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Barcelona – their biggest rival – have only managed to win La Liga 31% of the time and the Champions League on just two occasions. That’s a clear indication that when it comes to European soccer, Real Madrid is simply in a league of their own.</p>
<p>But it’s not just trophies that set Madrid apart from the rest. Their fans are also some of the most dedicated in the world. In fact, as The Observer points out, Santiago Bernabéu Stadium – home of Real Madrid – was one of only three stadiums in Europe to sell out every match during the 2016-2017 season. The other two? Atletico Madrid’s new stadium and Liverpool’s Anfield Stadium.</p>
<p>So why are Real Madrid so successful?</p>
<p>There are many reasons, but chief amongst them is undoubtedly their excellent coach, Zinédine Zidane. Since becoming manager in January 2016, he has led Los Blancos to victory in both La Liga and the Champions League – making him one of only three managers ever to do so. And with rumours swirling that he may be leaving at the end of this season, it looks like Real Madrid’s winning streak could come to an end soon enough.</p>
<p>Regardless of who takes over next season, however, one thing is for sure: Real Madrid is a dominant team that shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.</p>
<h1 id="Ronaldo-Continues-To-Impress-With-Powerful-Performance"><a href="#Ronaldo-Continues-To-Impress-With-Powerful-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Ronaldo Continues To Impress With Powerful Performance"></a>Ronaldo Continues To Impress With Powerful Performance</h1><p>Cristiano Ronaldo showed his power and dominance on Tuesday night as he led Juventus to a 3-0 win over Napoli in the Champion’s League. This was Ronaldo’s second consecutive hat-trick in the Champions League, proving that he is still one of the best players in the world.</p>
<p>Ronaldo opened up the scoring in the first minute with a powerful header, and then doubled Juve’s lead in the 33rd minute with an even more impressive long-range strike. He completed his hat-trick in the 65th minute with a clinical finish from close range, cementing Juve’s place at the top of their group.</p>
<p>This was an important win for Juventus, as they look to make a successful Champions League campaign this season. Ronaldo has now scored nine goals in his last six appearances for Juventus, and shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri was full of praise for Ronaldo after the game, stating that “Cristiano is extraordinary. He has now scored nine goals in six games. What more can I say?”</p>
<p>Ronaldo will be looking to continue his impressive form when Juventus take on Empoli in Serie A this weekend.</p>
<h1 id="Madrid-Crushes-Opponents-With-Impressive-Showing"><a href="#Madrid-Crushes-Opponents-With-Impressive-Showing" class="headerlink" title="Madrid Crushes Opponents With Impressive Showing"></a>Madrid Crushes Opponents With Impressive Showing</h1><p>Los Blancos put on an impressive display against Alavés, putting five goals past the Basque side and continuing their excellent form in the La Liga.</p>
<p>It was a dominant performance by Madrid, who attacked from the start and never looked like letting up. Gareth Bale got them off to a great start with two goals in the first nine minutes, and then Casemiro, Isco, and Asensio added further strikes to make it a 5-0 win.</p>
<p>Bale was once again at the heart of things for Madrid, scoring his fourth and fifth goals of the season and proving why he is such an important player for the club. Ronaldo also had a good game, assisting two of Bale’s goals and looking dangerous throughout.</p>
<p>The victory extends Madrid’s unbeaten run in La Liga to six games and keeps them in second place, just two points behind Barcelona. They will now look ahead to their Champions League clash with Tottenham Hotspur later this week, where they will be looking to make amends for their defeat at Wembley earlier this season.</p>
<h1 id="Ronaldo-Leads-Real-Madrid-to-Another-Victory"><a href="#Ronaldo-Leads-Real-Madrid-to-Another-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Ronaldo Leads Real Madrid to Another Victory"></a>Ronaldo Leads Real Madrid to Another Victory</h1><p>Cristiano Ronaldo was on fire as he led Real Madrid to a 3-1 victory against Liverpool in the Champions League final. He scored two goals, including an amazing bicycle kick in the first half, and was a driving force for Madrid throughout the match. This was his third consecutive Champions League title with Madrid, and his fifth overall, cementing his place as one of the all-time greats in European soccer.</p>
<p>Ronaldo has now won nine major trophies with Real Madrid, including four Champions League titles and three World Club Cups. He is also the all-time leading scorer in European club competition, with 120 goals. With Los Blancos, he has won every major trophy there is to win, and it’s hard to see anyone ever overtaking him as the best player in club history.</p>
<p>Madrid were the heavy favorites going into this match, but they didn’t make it easy on themselves. Liverpool created several good chances in the first half, and it took a moment of brilliance from Ronaldo to give them the lead. The Portuguese superstar flicked Gareth Bale’s cross into the air with his heel and then volleyed it past Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius into the top corner of the net. It was a goal that will go down in history, and it showed once again just how much of a threat Ronaldo can be when he’s on form.</p>
<p>Liverpool came out firing in the second half and equalized shortly after halftime through Sadio Mane. However, any hopes of a comeback were quickly extinguished as Ronaldo scored his second goal of the game just three minutes later. The Liverpudlians never really looked like scoring again after that, and Madrid ran out comfortable 3-1 winners.</p>
<p>This was an impressive performance by Zinedine Zidane’s side, who have now won three consecutive Champions League titles. They were clearly the better team on Saturday night, and there’s no doubt that Ronaldo was instrumental in their success. The 33-year-old continues to defy Father Time and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. He may not be immortal, but he sure comes close to it on occasions like this one.</p>
