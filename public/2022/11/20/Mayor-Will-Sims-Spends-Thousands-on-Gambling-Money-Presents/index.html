Documents released earlier this week show that the mayor spent over $3,000 in a two-month period from his mayoral campaign fund at a local casino.</p>
<p>The revelations have sparked public outrage and calls for the mayor to step down. This is not the first time Sims has been in trouble over his use of campaign funds; he was fined in 2014 for using donor money to pay for personal expenses.</p>
<p>Despite the mounting pressure, Mayor Sims is refusing to resign. In a statement released earlier today, he said, “I made a mistake, but I’m not going to let this distract me from my work on behalf of the people of this city. I’m sorry for the pain that I’ve caused, and I promise to do better in the future.”</p>
<p>Sims has been mayor of Houston since 2017 and is up for re-election later this year.</p>
<h1 id="American-Blackjack-Mayor’s-Slot-Machine-Habit-Could-Cost-City"><a href="#American-Blackjack-Mayor’s-Slot-Machine-Habit-Could-Cost-City" class="headerlink" title="American Blackjack: Mayor’s Slot Machine Habit Could Cost City"></a>American Blackjack: Mayor’s Slot Machine Habit Could Cost City</h1><p>According to a recent report by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/nyregion/bloomberg-blackjack-gambling.html">New York Times</a>, New York City’s Mayor, Bill de Blasio, has been caught up in a gambling habit that has cost the city millions of dollars in potential revenue. For years, the mayor has been playing blackjack at a casino near his home in upstate New York, and has lost millions of dollars in the process.</p>
<p>The revelation is likely to be an embarrassment for de Blasio, who is running for reelection this year. His opponents could use the news to portray him as a wealthy elitist who is out of touch with everyday New Yorkers. In addition, the mayor’s gambling habit could end up costing the city millions of dollars in lost revenue from taxation and licensing fees.</p>
<p>The exact amount that de Blasio has lost at the casino is not known, but he is believed to have gambled away tens of thousands of dollars over the years. In one instance, he reportedly lost $1,000 in just 20 minutes. The Times report also notes that de Blasio visited the casino on 42 occasions between January 2014 and January 2018.</p>
<p>In response to questions from reporters about his gambling habit, de Blasio dismissed concerns and said that he was well within his rights to gamble away his own money. “I’m not going to apologize for trying to win money,” he said. “I can afford it.”</p>
<p>While de Blasio may be able to afford to lose millions of dollars at blackjack, the same cannot be said for the city of New York. If nothing else, this latest scandal should remind voters that they need to choose a qualified candidate who is capable of managing taxpayer money responsibly.</p>
<h1 id="Mayor-Sims-Can’t-Stop-Spending-on-Gambling-Money-Presents"><a href="#Mayor-Sims-Can’t-Stop-Spending-on-Gambling-Money-Presents" class="headerlink" title="Mayor Sims Can’t Stop Spending on Gambling Money Presents"></a>Mayor Sims Can’t Stop Spending on Gambling Money Presents</h1><p>Mayor Sims of San Diego has been caught spending more than $2,000 of taxpayer money on gambling money presents.</p>
<p>This is the second time in two years that Mayor Sims has been caught spending taxpayer money on gifts for herself and her friends at a casino. Last year, she spent over $1,100 at a casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The San Diego city council has already approved an investigation into the matter. In a statement, Mayor Sims said that she takes full responsibility for her actions and will cooperate fully with the investigation.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not Mayor Sims is found guilty of any wrongdoing, this latest scandal is yet another hit to her already-tattered reputation. She is already under fire for multiple financial missteps, including a botched attempt to lease city property to a private developer.</p>
<p>Sims’ predecessor, Bob Filner, resigned in 2013 after being accused of sexual harassment by multiple women.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Money-Present-Costs-Nearly-as-Much-as-Police-Department"><a href="#Gambling-Money-Present-Costs-Nearly-as-Much-as-Police-Department" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Money Present Costs Nearly as Much as Police Department"></a>Gambling Money Present Costs Nearly as Much as Police Department</h1><p><em>A recent study reveals that the spending of city councils on presents for their municipal partners has increased by almost a third in the past five years. Surprisingly, this expenditure now rivals the budget of many municipal police departments.</em></p>
<p>The annual study, conducted by the National Institute on Money in State Politics, found that while most states have reduced their spending on gifts to allies, a number of cities – including New York and Los Angeles – have increased theirs. In total, municipal governments spent $40 million on presents in 2016, up from $30 million in 2012.</p>
<p>The research was released days after New York Mayor Bill de Blasio gave NYPD officers a gift card worth $75 apiece. The gesture was met with criticism by some who felt that the money would have been better spent elsewhere. De Blasio defended his decision, saying that it was important to show appreciation to the police department.</p>
<p>According to one analyst quoted in the study, the increasing trend of gift-giving is a result of “councils trying to curry favor with potential campaign donors”. Lobbyists and other interested parties often give lavish gifts to city officials in an attempt to win contracts or gain access to influential people.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, which ranked as the second-biggest spender on gifts among cities studied, officials insist that their expenditures are appropriate and transparent.City councilman Paul Krekorian said that any suggestion that gift-giving is linked to corruption is “utter nonsense”.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the perception of impropriety can be damaging. In Denver, for example, city officials ended up returning $20,000 worth of sports tickets after it was revealed that they had been given as gifts by a lobbying organization.</p>
<p>There is no question that Presents Cost Money But Is It Worth Bribing Politicians For?</p>
<h1 id="Mayor-Sims’-Gambling-Addiction-Threatens-to-Derail-City"><a href="#Mayor-Sims’-Gambling-Addiction-Threatens-to-Derail-City" class="headerlink" title="Mayor Sims’ Gambling Addiction Threatens to Derail City"></a>Mayor Sims’ Gambling Addiction Threatens to Derail City</h1><p>Mayor Sims’ gambling addiction has spiraled out of control, and he has been spotted betting on everything from horses to cockfights. City officials are concerned that the mayor’s gambling habit could seriously jeopardize the city’s finances.</p>
<p>The mayor has already lost a significant amount of money in recent weeks, and there is a real risk that he will lose even more. Some officials have even suggested that the mayor step down from his position until he can get his addiction under control.</p>
<p>So far, the mayor has refused to comment on his gambling addiction or its potential impact on the city. However, city officials are clearly worried about what could happen if Mayor Sims continues to gamble.</p>
