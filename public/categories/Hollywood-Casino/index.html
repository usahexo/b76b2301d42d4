<p>This fight has been in the works for quite some time, but it was finally confirmed by both fighters on social media this week. The first match, which took place in May of 2015, was a controversial one with many believing that Pacquiao had won. Mayweather ultimately emerged victorious after 12 rounds, however, and is now looking to make it two in a row against Pacquiao.</p>
<p>Mayweather is coming off of a victory over Conor McGregor this past August, while Pacquiao most recently lost to Jeff Horn in July of 2017. It’s unclear who is favored to win this rematch, but both fighters are certainly confident in their chances.</p>
<p>The MGM Grand casino is no stranger to big fights, having hosted bouts such as Mayweather vs. McGregor and Canelo Alvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin in recent years. With both Mayweather and Pacquiao boasting massive fanbases, there’s no doubt that this fight will be one of the biggest ever seen inside the MGM Grand Garden Arena.</p>
<h1 id="Who’s-the-best-bet-for-the-boxing-future"><a href="#Who’s-the-best-bet-for-the-boxing-future" class="headerlink" title="Who’s the best bet for the boxing future?"></a>Who’s the best bet for the boxing future?</h1><p>There is no clear-cut answer when it comes to who the best boxer in the world is. Several top boxers are currently at the top of their game, and it is anyone’s guess as to who will come out on top in the future.</p>
<p>Some of the most promising young boxers in the world today include Errol Spence Jr., Vasily Lomachenko, Terence Crawford, and Gennady Golovkin. All of these boxers boast impressive skills and records, and it will be interesting to see how their careers play out.</p>
<p>Errol Spence Jr. is a highly skilled welterweight boxer who has been making waves in the boxing world. He has an impressive record of 21 wins and 0 losses, with 18 of those wins coming by way of knockout. In May 2017, he defeated Kell Brook to win the IBF Welterweight title. He is currently slated to fight Lamont Peterson on January 20, 2018.</p>
<p>Vasily Lomachenko is a Ukrainian boxer who is considered by many to be one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world. He is a two-time Olympic gold medalist and has a professional record of 9 wins and 1 loss. In his most recent fight, he defeated Guillermo Rigondeaux by unanimous decision to become the WBO super featherweight champion.</p>
<p>Terence Crawford is an American boxer who currently holds the titles of WBO welterweight champion and WBC light welterweight champion. He has a professional record of 32 wins and 0 losses, with 23 wins coming by way of knockout. Crawford is known for his fast and powerful punches, as well as his elusiveness in the ring. He is scheduled to fight Jeff Horn on April 14, 2018 for the WBO welterweight title.</p>
<p>Gennady Golovkin is a Kazakhstani boxer who is considered by many to be one of the best middleweights in the world. He is a two-time World Boxing Association (WBA) Middleweight Champion and has a professional record of 37 wins and 0 losses, with 33 wins coming by way of knockout. In September 2017, he fought Saul “Canelo” Alvarez in what was billed as “the biggest fight in boxing history.” The fight resulted in a draw verdict.</p>

Pros weigh in on which Las Vegas casino is better for boxing"></a>MGM Grand or Caesars Palace? Pros weigh in on which Las Vegas casino is better for boxing</h1><p>The MGM Grand and Caesars Palace are two of the most popular casinos in Las Vegas for boxing. So, which one is better? Here’s a look at the pros and cons of each venue.</p>
<p>MGM Grand:</p>
<p>+The MGM Grand has a much bigger ring than the Caesars Palace. This is important for fight fans because it means they can get a better view of the action.</p>
<p>+The MGM Grand also has a more comfortable seating area than the Caesars Palace. This is another plus for fight fans.</p>
<p>-The MGM Grand can be quite noisy during fights, which can be distracting for some fans.</p>
<p>Caesars Palace:</p>
<p>+The Caesars Palace is more intimate than the MGM Grand, which gives it an advantage for boxing fans who want to get closer to the action.</p>
<p>+The Caesars Palace also offers better sightlines than the MGM Grand. This is particularly true for fans who are sitting in the front row.</p>
<h1 id="Mayweather-to-take-on-McGregor-at-new-Las-Vegas-casino"><a href="#Mayweather-to-take-on-McGregor-at-new-Las-Vegas-casino" class="headerlink" title="Mayweather to take on McGregor at new Las Vegas casino"></a>Mayweather to take on McGregor at new Las Vegas casino</h1><p>Las Vegas, the gambling capital of the world, is set to get even more action as Floyd Mayweather takes on Conor McGregor in a boxing match at a new casino.</p>
<p>The T-Mobile Arena, which just opened in April this year, has been confirmed as the venue for the much anticipated fight. While the two fighters have not yet come face to face in the ring, it is already generating huge interest from gamblers around the world.</p>
<p>Mayweather is considered one of the best boxers of all time and is unbeaten in his professional career. McGregor, on the other hand, is a mixed martial artist who has never boxed before. He does however, have a 21-3 record in MMA.</p>
<p>Bookmakers are already taking bets on the outcome of the fight and Mayweather is currently odds-on favourite to win with odds of 1&#x2F;6 at most bookmakers. McGregor is at 4&#x2F;1 to cause an upset.</p>
<p>The bout will be one of the most lucrative fights in history and is expected to generate over £500 million in revenue. It will also be one of the most watched fights of all time with an estimated global audience of 1 billion people.</p>
<h1 id="Which-casino-should-you-put-your-money-on-for-the-next-big-fight"><a href="#Which-casino-should-you-put-your-money-on-for-the-next-big-fight" class="headerlink" title="Which casino should you put your money on for the next big fight?"></a>Which casino should you put your money on for the next big fight?</h1><p>There is no one definitive answer to this question. Different casino players prefer different venues for a variety of reasons. Some people like the atmosphere and excitement of playing in a land-based casino, while others prefer the convenience and anonymity of online gambling.</p>
<p>But before we get into discussing the pros and cons of different casinos, let’s take a look at the upcoming boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr and Conor McGregor. This is sure to be one of the most anticipated bouts in recent history, so there is no doubt that many gamblers will be looking to put their money down on the outcome.</p>
<p>Mayweather is unsurprisingly the favourite to win, with odds of 1&#x2F;5 according to Paddy Power Sports. McGregor is considered a much bigger underdog, with odds of 9&#x2F;2. If you are planning on betting on this fight, these are the kind of odds you will be looking at.</p>
<p>So which casino should you choose if you want to back Mayweather? Well, if you are based in the United Kingdom, then Paddy Power Sports would be a good option. However, if you are based in the United States then you may want to consider William Hill instead. They both offer competitive betting odds and have a reputation for being fair and trustworthy operators.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don’t mind placing your bets online then Bet365 Sports is another good option. They offer a wide range of markets for sports betting as well as an extensive selection of casino games. So whatever your preferences, there is likely to be a suitable online casino for you.</p>
