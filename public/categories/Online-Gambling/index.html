<p>The Virtus Bologna poker team has been making a name for itself on the national stage for a number of years now, and the players are determined to make their mark on the international poker scene. Led by captain Massimo Di Cicco, the team comprises some of the best players in Italy, including Giovanni Angioni and Mirko Tramontana.</p>
<p>The Virtus Bologna team has already achieved some impressive results this year, winning numerous tournaments and cash games in both live and online formats. In May, they took down first place in a €1,000 buy-in tournament at Casino Lugano in Switzerland, taking home a prize pool of over €10,000. They followed this up with another victory at the same casino a few weeks later, this time winning a €2,000 buy-in event.</p>
<p>In July, they travelled to Prague to compete in the European Poker Tour (EPT) Festival there. The team did extremely well, with Tramontana finishing runner-up in the €5,000 buy-in main event and Di Cicco securing fourth place in the €10,000 High Roller event. These impressive results have seen Virtus Bologna climb to second place on the Italian nationwide rankings.</p>
<p>The team is now looking to cement its place as the top dog in Italian poker by conquering new territories. In October they will be travelling to London to compete in the 888Live Poker Festival there. This will be their first major international tournament and they are determined to make a big impact. With so many talented players on board, Virtus Bologna is definitely one team to watch out for!</p>

<p>Led by coach Stefano Sacripanti, the team has been busy in the offseason, bringing in some new players that should help them improve on their 9th place finish from last year.</p>
<p>One of the most notable signings was that of former NBA player Andrea Bargnani, who is expected to provide some much-needed firepower up front.</p>
<p>Other new arrivals include Luigi Datome, Amath M’Baye and Michael Thompson, all of whom should add some much-needed depth to the roster.</p>
<p>The fans are certainly excited about the prospect of seeing their team compete at a higher level this season, and with a bit of luck they could even make a run at qualifying for the playoffs.</p>
