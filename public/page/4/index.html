<h1 id="When-is-Womens-Diving-Day-A-Global-Festival-of-Women-in-Sport"><a href="#When-is-Womens-Diving-Day-A-Global-Festival-of-Women-in-Sport" class="headerlink" title="When is Womens Diving Day A Global Festival of Women in Sport?"></a>When is Womens Diving Day A Global Festival of Women in Sport?</h1><p>The inaugural Women’s Diving Day is a global festival of women in sport taking place on 1st December 2019. The day is coordinated by the Women’s International Dive Federation (WIDF), and celebrates the outstanding achievements of women in diving, and across all levels of sport.</p>
<p>The day is open to everyone, with events taking place around the world to get more girls and women involved in diving, and sport more broadly. This could be anything from giving someone their first ever try at diving, to holding an exhibition match or tournament, to running a sports workshop or seminar.</p>
<p>Why Women’s Diving Day?</p>
<p>Despite being one of the most popular Olympic sports, with huge spectator interest and some of the most dedicated fans in the world, diving has long been seen as a male-dominated domain. In recent years there have been great strides made to change this, but there is still much work to do.</p>
<p>One way to help address this imbalance is by celebrating the successes of women in diving, and inspiring more girls and young women to take up the sport. Women’s Diving Day does just that, providing a focal point for all things female-diving related, and showcasing the amazing talent that exists within the sport.</p>
<p>Who can get involved?</p>
<p>Women’s Diving Day is open to anyone who wants to get involved. Whether you’re a dive enthusiast or complete beginner, whether you compete at an elite level or just like to dabble recreationally; if you want to celebrate women in diving then Women’s Diving Day is for you!</p>
<p>How can I get involved?</p>
<p>There are lots of ways you can get involved in Women’s Diving Day: hold an event yourself, sign up for or organise an event hosted by someone else, or simply show your support online using #WomensDivingDay. You can find out more about how to get involved on the WIDF website (widf.org).</p>
<h1 id="Where-is-Womens-Diving-Day-A-Global-Festival-of-Women-in-Sport"><a href="#Where-is-Womens-Diving-Day-A-Global-Festival-of-Women-in-Sport" class="headerlink" title="Where is Womens Diving Day A Global Festival of Women in Sport?"></a>Where is Womens Diving Day A Global Festival of Women in Sport?</h1><p>First celebrated in 2014, Women’s Diving Day is a global festival of women in sport. This day celebrates the amazing accomplishments of women everywhere in the sport of diving, and works to raise awareness of the barriers that still exist for women in sport.</p>
<p>Despite being one of the oldest sports in the world, women’s participation in diving has only recently begun to be taken seriously. There are still many challenges and obstacles that face female divers, ranging from a lack of resources and opportunity to unequal pay and discrimination.</p>
<p>Female divers have worked hard to break down these barriers, and on Women’s Diving Day we celebrate their achievements and continue to work towards equality for all. This day is also an opportunity to encourage more girls and women to get involved in diving, as well as other sports, and show them that anything is possible with hard work and determination.</p>
<p>So what can you do to help celebrate Women’s Diving Day? Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Share your favorite female diver on social media using the hashtag #WomensDivingDay.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spend some time learning about some of the amazing female divers who have been pioneers in the sport. Some excellent resources include the Women Divers Hall of Fame and She Can Dive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take part in or donate to a charity or organisation that supports girls and women in sport. Some great organisations to check out include Girls Play Sports, SHE CAN Sports, and Women Win.</p>

<h1 id="Why-is-Womens-Diving-Day-A-Global-Festival-of-Women-in-Sport"><a href="#Why-is-Womens-Diving-Day-A-Global-Festival-of-Women-in-Sport" class="headerlink" title="Why is Womens Diving Day A Global Festival of Women in Sport?"></a>Why is Womens Diving Day A Global Festival of Women in Sport?</h1><p>On the 5th of March each year, Women’s Diving Day is observed globally to celebrate the achievements of women in sport, and more specifically, in diving. This day was founded by Anita DeFrantz, an Olympic gold medalist in rowing and advocate for gender equity in sport. The aim of this day is to create greater visibility for women in sport and break down barriers that have been preventing them from achieving their full potential.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why Women’s Diving Day is so important is because it helps to shine a spotlight on the many injustices that women face when trying to participate in sport. For example, female athletes often receive less funding and media coverage than their male counterparts, despite performing just as well or even better. Additionally, there are many cases of discrimination and sexual harassment towards female athletes, which can prevent them from reaching their full potential.</p>
<p>By observing Women’s Diving Day each year, we can help to raise awareness of these issues and work towards creating a more equitable sporting landscape for women. Not only does this benefit women directly, but it also has a positive impact on society as a whole. When women are given equal opportunities to participate in sport, they can achieve amazing things both on and off the field. This is something that we should all be striving for!</p>

The president also committed to continue supporting the work of Somali female divers through investments in training, equipment, infrastructure and other initiatives that will help advance their work.</p>
<p>The SFWDA has more than 1,000 members who are active divers working in coastal areas throughout Somalia.

<p>Diving is an important source of income for many Somali women and helps provide needed financial security for themselves and their families. The SFWDA is working to increase the number of women entering into the profession, with the goal of empowering more Somali women through diving and creating a more equitable society.</p>
