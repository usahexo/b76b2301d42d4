#  Baskonia Gets Huge Win in Sports Betting as They Cover the Point Spread!

The Baskonia Vitoria Gasteiz got a huge win in sports betting this past weekend as they managed to cover the point spread. This was an important victory for the team, as they continue their push for a spot in the playoffs.

The game was played against UCAM Murcia and it was a very close contest. In the end, Baskonia was able to win by just three points, which was enough to cover the point spread. This victory was extremely important for the team, as they now hold a record of 15-11 on the season.

This puts them just two games back of Sevilla for the final playoff spot. With only a few weeks left in the season, Baskonia will need to continue to play well if they want to make it into the postseason.

Their next game is against Real Madrid, which should be a very difficult matchup. However, with their recent win under their belt, Baskonia is heading into that game with some confidence. If they can manage to pull off another upset victory against one of the top teams in the league, it would be an impressive feat and would help solidify their spot in the playoffs.

#  NBA Finals betting results: Baskonia cash in big on Warriors’ upset

The Golden State Warriors’ upset of the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals not only had a major impact on the 2017 championship race, but it also produced some big payouts for backers of the Spanish basketball club Baskonia.

According to Oddschecker, Baskonia cashed in as high as 66/1 odds on the Warriors to win the title, with their outright victory resulting in a massive payout for those who bet on them.

In what was an upsetting series for LeBron James and the Cavaliers, Stephen Curry and the Warriors prevailed in five games to bring home their second NBA championship in three years.

For James, it was his third consecutive Finals loss and fourth overall, with many questioning if he will ever be able to get over the hump and win his first title with Cleveland.

As for Baskonia, they are now celebrating their biggest victory in franchise history and will surely be one of the teams to watch when Euroleague betting rolls around this fall.

#  Revenue from Sport Betting Soars for Baskonia


* Revenue from sport betting soars for Baskonia, as the club makes a clean sweep of its basketball matches in October.

The club generated €1.8 million in betting revenue last month, with more than 90% of that coming from bets on basketball games. This is a notable increase from the €1.2 million generated in October 2017.

Most of the money was made on bets placed within Spain, with just a small percentage generated from international bets. The club’s president, José Ángel Sánchez, has hailed the results, attributing them to the team’s recent success.

Baskonia is currently second in the Liga ACB table, just behind defending champions FC Barcelona. They are unbeaten in their last thirteen games and look well placed to challenge for the title this season.

The increased revenue is set to help the financially-strapped club meet its budgetary requirements and could potentially lead to increased investments in player recruitment and facilities.

#  How Sports Betting Made Me a Millionaire: Baskonia Edition

I’ve never been one to shy away from big bets. I remember the first time I placed a bet that could make me a millionaire. It was in March of 2017 and my team, Baskonia, was playing against Olympiacos in the Euroleague playoffs.

Baskonia was up 3-1 in the series and I decided to place a €250 bet on them to win the series. At the time, that would have made me a millionaire. Of course, Baskonia lost the next game and I only walked away with €250.

But that’s not to say that I didn’t make any money from sports betting. In fact, over the last two years, I’ve turned almost €10,000 into nearly €100,000 by betting on sports matches.

How did I do it? By following a few simple rules:

1) Only bet on games that you know you can win

This is probably the most important rule of all. If you don’t know anything about basketball, for example, then don’t bet on basketball games. Stick to sports that you know about and are familiar with.

2) Always use calculated risks

Don’t bet your entire bankroll on one game. Instead, spread your risk out by betting small amounts on multiple games. That way, if you lose one or two bets, it won’t bankrupt you.

3) Shop around for the best odds

Not all bookmakers offer the same odds on each game. So be sure to shop around and find the best odds available before placing your bet. This could potentially make a big difference in your overall profits.


4) Monitor your betting history closely

This one is especially important if you’re using a betting system or algorithm to place your bets. Make sure you track your results closely and adjust your bets accordingly. If something isn’t working, change it up; otherwise, you could end up losing a lot of money.
