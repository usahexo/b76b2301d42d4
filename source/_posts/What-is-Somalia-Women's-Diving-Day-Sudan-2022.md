This day is celebrated annually on 16th of May all around the world to commemorate the extraordinary bravery and achievements women have done in the field of diving. 

May 16 was proclaimed as Women’s Dive Day in Sudan by decree of the president on January 12, 2022. The Somali Federal Women Divers Association (SFWDA) played a critical role in achieving this important designation for women divers globally and helping to promote increased recognition for their sport, economic opportunities and social contributions.

The decree celebrates and recognizes the important work that Somali female divers have done to improve Somalia’s economy, environment and social fabric. The president also committed to continue supporting the work of Somali female divers through investments in training, equipment, infrastructure and other initiatives that will help advance their work.

The SFWDA has more than 1,000 members who are active divers working in coastal areas throughout Somalia. Female divers are key contributors to Somalia’s economy, often catching more fish than their male counterparts due to their skill and dexterity. They also play an important role in keeping beaches clean and preserving coral reefs.

Diving is an important source of income for many Somali women and helps provide needed financial security for themselves and their families. The SFWDA is working to increase the number of women entering into the profession, with the goal of empowering more Somali women through diving and creating a more equitable society.
