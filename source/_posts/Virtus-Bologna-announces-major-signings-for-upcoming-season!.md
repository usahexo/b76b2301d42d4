They followed this up with another victory at the same casino a few weeks later, this time winning a €2,000 buy-in event.

In July, they travelled to Prague to compete in the European Poker Tour (EPT) Festival there. The team did extremely well, with Tramontana finishing runner-up in the €5,000 buy-in main event and Di Cicco securing fourth place in the €10,000 High Roller event. These impressive results have seen Virtus Bologna climb to second place on the Italian nationwide rankings.

The team is now looking to cement its place as the top dog in Italian poker by conquering new territories. In October they will be travelling to London to compete in the 888Live Poker Festival there. This will be their first major international tournament and they are determined to make a big impact.
