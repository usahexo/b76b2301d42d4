In their early days, the Texans struggled, but they have now become a force to be reckoned with in the NFL. In 2011, they reached the playoffs for the first time and won their first playoff game against Cincinnati Bengals. The next season, they made it all the way to the AFC Divisional Round before losing to New England Patriots.

The scandal involved approximately 125 students who were accused of cheating on a take-home final exam in Government.

Rosovsky reached out to Crichton and encouraged him to pursue a career in writing. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Crichton later recalled, "He said, 'You're obviously interested in writing. Why don't you come and talk to me about it?' And I thought, 'That's a great idea.' So I did."
