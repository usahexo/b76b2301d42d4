#  Michael Crichton's What is Rummy and Pair Blackjack?

In the late 1990s, two games hit the casino gaming floors that were slightly different than anything that had been seen before. They were both created by Michael Crichton, an author and filmmaker who also happened to be a blackjack and rummy enthusiast.

The first game was called What is Rummy? It was based on the classic card game rummy, but with some twists to make it more interesting for casino players. The basic idea is to collect sets of cards of the same rank, or runs of consecutive cards of the same suit. The player who removes all of their cards from their hand first wins the round.

What is Rummy? quickly became popular among casino players, and can still be found in casinos today. It is usually offered as a six- or eight-deck game, where players can bet on the table or play against the dealer.

The second game created by Crichton was called Pair Blackjack. It is a variation of blackjack that uses two decks of cards instead of one, and pays out two times the amount for a pair instead of one. Like blackjack, players can bet on the table or against the dealer. Pair Blackjack quickly became just as popular as What is Rummy?, and can also still be found in casinos today.

#  Michael Crichton explores the mystery of Rummy and Pair Blackjack

Rummy and Pair Blackjack are card games that have been around for centuries. But what is the mystery behind these games?

Rummy is a game in which players draw cards and discard using two or more decks of cards. The goal of the game is to be the first player to discard all their cards. Rummy can be played with two or more players.

Pair Blackjack is a game in which players are dealt two cards, and must make two hands from these two cards. The first hand is composed of two cards of the same rank, such as two kings. The second hand is composed of any other two cards. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If both hands have the same rank, then it is a tie, and no one wins.

#  Is there more to life than just Rummy and Pair Blackjack? Find out from Michael Crichton 

In the early 1970s, Michael Crichton was a medical student at Harvard and a budding writer. He dabbled in writing screenplays, one of which would eventually be made into the movie Westworld. But it was his first novel, Jurassic Park, that would make him a household name. 

Crichton wasn't just a successful novelist, he was also a prolific screenwriter and director. In 1994, he directed and wrote the movie ER, which would go on to win two Emmys for best drama series. 

Crichton's work often explored controversial topics like biotechnology (Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain), climate change (State of Fear), and addiction (A Scanner Darkly). But his most popular work, by far, was the book and movie Jurassic Park. 

Michael Crichton passed away in 2008 after a battle with cancer. He was 66 years old.

In the early 1970s, medical doctor and author Michael Crichton wrote and directed the film, "Westworld." The movie was about a high-tech amusement park where visitors could act out their fantasies in a simulated Old West environment. The robots in the park started going haywire, and the guests found themselves in danger.

Crichton's next novel, 1974's "The Terminal Man," was also made into a movie starring George Segal. In the book, a man has surgery that makes him susceptible to seizures. He starts having seizures that cause him to go into murderous rage; eventually he is confined to a hospital where scientists experiment on him in an effort to find a cure.

Crichton's books were popularly known as science fiction, but that wasn't really what they wereâ€”they were thrillers with science fiction elements. In 1976, Crichton published "Jurassic Park," which would become his most famous book. It was made into a movie in 1993, and again in 2015.

"Jurassic Park" is about a billionaire who builds a theme park on an island filled with dinosaurs cloned from DNA extracted from mosquitoes that had bitten mosquitoes that had bitten dinosaurs. Predictably, things go wrong and the dinosaurs escape.

It's interesting to note that when Crichton wrote "Jurassic Park," the only way to sequence DNA was by hand. The first complete human genome wasn't sequenced until 2003.

Crichton didn't just write novels; he also wrote screenplays for movies such as "Coma" (1978), "The Andromeda Strain" (1971), and "Timeline" (2003). And he wasn't just a writer; he was also a director. He directed episodes of TV shows such as "ER" and "Threshold."

Crichton died in 2008 at the age of 66 from injuries sustained in a plane crash. He left behind a wife and two children.
