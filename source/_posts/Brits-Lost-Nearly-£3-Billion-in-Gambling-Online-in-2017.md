#  Brits Lost Nearly £3 Billion in Gambling Online in 2017

 British gamblers lost a record £2.9 billion on online casino and betting sites in 2017, an increase of 11% from the previous year, according to a new study.

The research, carried out by UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), also found that the amount staked by British players online had risen by 15% to £14.5 billion. Slot machines were the most popular type of game, accounting for more than half of all money gambled.

The figures are likely to reignite concerns about the level of gambling addiction in Britain, which is thought to affect around half a million people. The government has been under pressure to introduce tougher regulations to protect vulnerable customers.

“These figures reinforce our serious concerns about the risks posed to consumers by gambling, particularly via digital channels,” said Neil McArthur, Chief Executive at UKGC. “They should also act as a wake-up call to gambling firms who need to do more to protect their customers and ensure they gamble responsibly.”

Last year the commission proposed changes which would see online casinos forced to limit losses and stakes for problem gamblers, and stop them from using credit cards and other payment methods to fund their bets. The proposals have yet to be implemented, however.

The government has also said it will introduce a new levy on gambling operators in order to raise funds for treatment of addiction and related problems. The amount raised by the levy is still being negotiated, but is expected to be in the region of £100 million per year.

#  U.S. Gamblers Lose $47.5 Billion in 2017

The gambling industry in the United States is growing rapidly, but not all of the news from the industry is good. According to a recent study by the Harvard Medical School, U.S. gamblers lost a total of $47.5 billion in 2017. That’s a 4% increase over the losses reported in 2016, and it works out to an average loss of $1,500 per gambler.

The study also found that, while men continue to lose more money than women when it comes to gambling, women are catching up rapidly. In 2017, women accounted for 47% of all gambling losses in the U.S., compared to just 41% in 2016.

At the same time, there are some signs that the gambling industry may be starting to plateau. While overall losses continue to grow, the rate at which they are growing has slowed down considerably in recent years. In fact, if the trend continues, it’s possible that losses will start to decline within the next decade or so.

So what’s driving these losses? The main culprit appears to be casino gambling, which accounts for more than two-thirds of all gambling losses in the U.S. Lotteries come in second place, with horse racing and dog racing rounding out the top four.

There are a number of possible explanations for why casino gambling is so popular (and addictive). It’s easy to lose track of time and money when you’re playing casino games, and the games can be quite deceptive in terms of how much you can win or lose on any given spin or hand. And unlike other forms of gambling, such as lotteries or sports betting, there’s no skill involved in playing casino games – it’s purely luck whether you win or lose.

So what can be done to address this problem? One possibility is increasing regulation of the gambling industry, including requirements that casinos make it easier for patrons to track their spending and bets. Another possibility is increasing awareness about the risks associated with casino gambling, particularly among those who are most likely to be affected by it – namely, men aged 18-35.

Ultimately though, it’s up to each individual gambler to take responsibility for his or her own actions and make sure that they understand just how risky casino gambling can be.

#  Australians Lose A Whopping $1.4 Billion On Gambling In 2017

Australians have continued to lose a lot of money gambling, with figures released by the Australian Gambling Statistics report indicating that losses amounted to $1.4 billion in 2017. This is a slight decrease from the $1.5 billion lost in 2016, but it nonetheless shows that a significant amount of money is being wagered each year.

The report also found that approximately 3.9 million Australians were involved in some form of gambling activities in 2017. This equates to more than half of the population, and it indicates that gambling is a popular pastime for many people in Australia.

While there are various forms of gambling, poker machines account for the lion’s share of losses, with Australians spending more than $870 million on pokies in 2017. This was an increase from the $860 million lost on pokies in 2016.

Crown Casino was again the biggest loser, with gamblers losing more than $373 million at the Melbourne casino in 2017. This was an increase from the $363 million lost at Crown Casino in 2016. The Star Casino was next on the list, with gamblers losing more than $301 million at the Sydney casino in 2017. This was a decrease from the $319 million lost at The Star Casino in 2016.

While casinos are big losers when it comes to gambling losses, other forms of gambling are also proving costly for Australians. Sports betting continues to be popular, with Australians spending more than $728 million on sports bets in 2017. This was a slight decrease from the $741 million spent on sports bets in 2016. Wagering on horseracing was also down slightly, with Australians spending more than $563 million on bets in 2017 compared to nearly $600 million in 2016.

It would appear that Australians are becoming increasingly cautious when it comes to gambling, as evidenced by the slight decreases seen across most forms of gambling last year. However, with losses still totalling more than $1billion annually, it’s clear that there is still plenty of work to be done when it comes to tackling problem gambling in Australia

#  Online Gambling A Growing Threat To Seniors Finances

According to a study released by the University of Nevada, Reno, online gambling is becoming a growing threat to seniors’ finances. The study found that as many as 1 in 3 people over the age of 60 engages in some form of online gambling. This can include activities such as betting on sports, playing casino games, or participating in lotteries.

The potential risks associated with online gambling are numerous. For one, seniors may be more likely to experience financial hardship if they lose money while gambling online. Additionally, there is also a risk of fraud and identity theft. Seniors may not be as savvy about protecting their personal information when gambling online, making them more susceptible to scams.

Another concern is that online gambling can be addictive. Seniors who get caught up in an addiction may find themselves spending more and more time and money on gambling. This can lead to serious financial problems and even ruin their retirement plans.

If you are a senior, it is important to be aware of the dangers of online gambling before you decide to participate. Be sure to do your research and understand the risks involved before opening an account or making any bets. If you think you may have a problem with gambling, seek help from a qualified professional.

#  Study Shows That Online Gambling Costs Canadians Billions Each Year

Online gambling is a huge industry that continues to grow every year. This type of gambling is readily available to Canadians, and a recent study has shown that it is costing them billions of dollars each year.

The study, which was conducted by the Canadian Gaming Association, found that online gambling costs Canadians nearly $4 billion each year. This number includes losses from both provincial and national lotteries, as well as casino games and sports betting.

This cost is significant, and it is something that Canada’s lawmakers should take into consideration when they are debating the future of online gambling in the country. In particular, policymakers need to weigh the potential benefits of legalizing this type of gambling against the potential harms to consumers.

One potential harm is that people can lose a lot of money through online gambling. This study found that the average Canadian loses about $670 per year on this type of gambling. This amount can be harmful to people’s finances and can lead to serious debt problems.

Another potential harm is that online gambling can be addictive. This means that some people can get hooked on this type of activity and will end up spending more money than they intended to. This can lead to financial problems, as well as other health issues.

Despite these potential harms, online gambling does have some potential benefits. For one thing, it can be fun and entertaining for people who enjoy it. It can also be a way for people to make some extra money if they are lucky enough to win.

In addition, online gambling can provide jobs and economic benefits for provinces and municipalities that decide to legalize it. For example, casinos and other venues where online gambling takes place can create jobs for residents in these areas.

Overall, there are pros and cons to legalizing online gambling in Canada. Policymakers need to weigh all of these factors carefully before making a decision on this issue.
